# Week1-Refactoring-Homework
This website is a landing page for the marketing company Horiseon. It includes basic descriptions of their services and the benefits of hiring them.

Horiseon has requested a refactoring for the sake of accessibility and SEO rankings.

## Adjustments
* HTML has been updated to be semantic; div's were removed and replaced with semantic tags such as main, aside, header, footer and section. Stylesheet was updated accordingly.
* It was noted in the CSS file that classes we redudant and so were consolidated and updated in the index file.
* All images were updated with alt tags and the hero image had a title added.
